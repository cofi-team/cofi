cofi
====

cofi (command finder) is a kind of knowledge database with a small gui to searchand find commands. Everybody who works with a lot of commands knows the situation where you need a special command (for example: create user for postgres db) and you don't know the correct syntax. The first you have done is open the web browser and have googled the command. At the meantime the results in google are untransparent and unclear because of the huge amount of advertising.

Here cofi can help you to quickly find out your right command without ad and without to click through links until you find your command. With cofi you need just to put in what you are looking for (for example: create user pg) and you get very fast all suitable commands. The result list will be very short because of an intelligent search algorithm.
